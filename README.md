This code performs a machine learning classification analysis on the Breast Cancer dataset using a Decision Tree Classifier. It begins by loading and converting the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame, then displays basic dataset information and checks for missing values. After splitting the data into training and test sets, it initializes and trains a Decision Tree Classifier, makes predictions, and evaluates the modelâ€™s performance using accuracy score, classification report, and a confusion matrix. The confusion matrix is visualized using a heatmap. Additionally, the code plots a simplified version of the decision tree and computes feature importances, which are then visualized in a bar plot to identify the most influential features in the classification model. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the model's accuracy, classification performance, and feature significance.
